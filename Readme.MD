A Machine Learning project that predicts personality traits based on user inputs, featuring a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

![Screenshot of App Interface](path/to/your/screenshot.png) ## 📜 Description

This project aims to predict an individual's personality type (e.g., based on the Big Five or Myers-Briggs model) using machine learning. The model is trained on a dataset of personality survey responses. The interactive web application, built with **Streamlit**, allows users to input their data and receive a real-time personality prediction.

The entire data analysis and model-building process is documented in the accompanying **Jupyter Notebook**.

***

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive UI:** A simple and intuitive web interface for users to enter their information.
* **Real-time Predictions:** Get instant personality trait predictions based on the trained model.
* **Data Exploration:** The Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training steps.
* **Scalable:** Easy to retrain the model with new data or experiment with different algorithms.

***

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend & Modeling:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/HetSantoki/Personality-Model-Predictor.git]
    cd Personality-Model-Predictor
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    *(Note: If the `requirements.txt` file is not present, you can generate it by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` within your activated virtual environment after installing the necessary packages.)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Launch the Streamlit app:**
    *(Replace `app.py` with the name of your main Streamlit script if it's different.)*
    ```bash
    streamlit run app2.py
    ```

2.  Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
